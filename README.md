# PySLR (a tool to aid in Systematic Literature Reviews)

PySLR is a simple, Python-written CLI tool (inspired in [slR](https://github.com/jcppc/slR), a similar tool but in R) to generate plots from XSLX tables with bibliography information.
These tables can be automatically generated from Bibtex files, needing only human input to classify and add additional information.

## How to use

The JSON configurations file (config.json) must be present in the root folder of the code.
It must be filled with the names of the paths, folders, and files containing the inputs and outputs of the tool.
